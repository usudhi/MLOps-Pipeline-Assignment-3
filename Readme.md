## Name: Sudheesh U
## Roll No: G24AI1057

## 1. Introduction
## This the process of building a complete, automated MLOps pipeline. The project encompasses several key stages of the machine learning lifecycle: initial model development, containerization with Docker, automated testing and deployment through a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions, and finally, model optimization via manual quantization. The primary goal is to demonstrate a practical understanding of MLOps principles by creating a reproducible and automated workflow from code to deployment.
